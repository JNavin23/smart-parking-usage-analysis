# Smart Parking Usage Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes smart parking usage data to understand parking behavior, revenue patterns, time-based trends, and violation behavior.  
The goal is to simulate a real-world data analyst workflow from raw data to actionable insights.

## Dataset
- Time-series data (entry time)
- Includes vehicle type, user type, duration, revenue, payment mode, and violations
- Dataset was intentionally messy and cleaned as part of the analysis process

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and validation
- Time-based analysis (hourly, daily, monthly patterns)
- Parking usage and revenue trends
- Vehicle type and user type segmentation
- Violation behavior analysis
- Business-focused visualizations

## Key Insights
- Peak parking usage and peak revenue hours differ
- Short-duration parking dominates overall usage
- Certain vehicle types contribute disproportionately to revenue
- Violation rates increase during high-congestion hours

  
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook `Smart_Parking_Usage_Analysis.ipynb`
3. Run cells sequentially
